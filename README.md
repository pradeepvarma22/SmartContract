# The problem CustodianCode NFT Marketplace solves

#### Walletless Onboarding
Users can log in using their Google or Twitter account, and if they already have a wallet, they can simply connect it to
their profile. If the user does not have a wallet, a new wallet will be created for them. This allows for a simple and
easy onboarding process for users who may not be familiar with wallets or crypto.

#### Flexible Payment Options
Sellers can list NFTs for sale with either crypto or fiat, and buyers can purchase NFTs using the same currency. This
provides more payment options and makes it easier for buyers to participate in the marketplace.

#### NFT Auctions
Marketplace allows the admin to auction off NFTs, creating a more dynamic and engaging buying experience for buyers.
Only the admin can sell items in auctions, ensuring that the auction process is secure and properly managed.
Easy Listing Process:
allows sellers to list their NFTs without needing any coding experience. This means that artists and other creators can
easily sell their NFTs without needing to know how to code. This makes it more accessible for everyone to participate in
the marketplace.

#### Transaction Data
All transaction data is recorded on the Mantle blockchain, providing an immutable record of all transactions that occur
on the marketplace including fiat payments. This ensures that all transactions are secure and transparent.
